# Synchronisation

Enabled: Disabled
Joplin periodically connects to GitHub to check for new releases.: Joplin supports synchronisation of your notes across multiple devices. If you choose to synchronise with a third-party, such as OneDrive, the notes will be sent to your OneDrive account, in which case the third-party privacy policy applies.
