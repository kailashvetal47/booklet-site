# Prefix

For example, searching for cat will return all the notes that contain this exact word. Note: it will not return the notes that contain the substring - thus, for "cat", notes that contain "cataclysmic" or "prevaricate" will not be returned.: swim* - will return all the notes that contain eg. "swim", but also "swimming", "swimsuit", etc. IMPORTANT: The wildcard can only be at the end - it will be ignored at the beginning of a word (eg. *swim) and will be treated as a literal asterisk in the middle of a word (eg. ast*rix)
Returns all the notes that contain this term.: Add a wildcard to return all the notes that contain a term with a specified prefix.
