title: Is unity DEBUG preprocessor always defined? Yes, by design. - Unity Forum

So in case someone will have the same problem, I received an answer from Unity:

"The editor is always in DEBUG by design. There are many different functions and messages for debugging which by default work on editor while on standalone or any platforms you need to enable development build for that."

So #if DEBUG seems to be the same as #if UNITY_EDITOR
